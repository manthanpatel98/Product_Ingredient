# Product_Ingredient
This Project for identifying whether the Product Ingredients are harmful or not. Currently, the project is focused on Shampoo.


## Motivation:
Idea of making this Project came when i was looking for a good and natural shampoo product online and faced issue because of so many **varieties** and **harmful chemicals** ingredients in products.

## Study:
* For the project, I have done a research on most common **harmful** and **natural** ingredients which are used in the Shmapoo.
* During my research, I have found that many ingredients, that have been used in the Product, are so harmful that they are **banned in many countries** but still they are used in the Product. On top of this, some companies do not want you to know about the ingredients so they **do not mention** the Ingredients even on their websites. They also make sure that, they do not display the Product picture with its Ingredient Label. In short, do not buy product if the product ingredient label is not there.
* As a customer we should be aware about ingredients that have been used in the product, because it can cause serious harm to our body.So, before buying any product, take sometime to research about Product Ingredients.

## Project:
* The Project is a combination of **OCR** + **Text Scrapping** + **Image Scrapping** + **Study regarding common harmful & natural Ingredients in Product**. (Currently for **Shampoos**).
