# Product_Ingredient
This Project for identifying whether the Product Ingredients are harmful or not. Currently, the project is focused on Shampoo.


## Motivation:
Idea of making this Project came when i was looking for a good and natural shampoo product online and faced issue because of so many **varieties** and **harmful chemicals** ingredients in products .

## Project:
* The Project is a combination of **OCR** + **Text Scrapping** + **Image Scrapping** + **Study regarding common harmful & natural Ingredients in Product**. (Currently for **Shampoos**).

but because of so many variety and alot of comapanies using harmful chemicals, I was confused
